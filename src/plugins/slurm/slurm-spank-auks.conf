# Auks SLURM spank plugin configuration file
# 
# this plugin can be used to leverage an already installed Auks infrastructure
# to add credential support to Slurm
#
# The following configuration parameters are available :
#
# default=disabled|enabled  : set auks plugin default behavior (enabled/disabled)
#                             The default value is disabled.
#
# spankstackcred=yes|no     : when the ticket are acquired on the slurmstepd 
#                             side, set the KRB5CCNAME in the job environment 
#                             in order to allow the following spank plugins to 
#                             act in a kerberized environment.
#                             The default value is no.
#
# minimum_uid=uid           : enable to set a treshold on user numerical 
#                             identifier that let the possibility to ignore
#                             auks logic for certain users.
#                             The default value is 0.
#
# sync=mode                 : enable to automatically sync file systems 
# 			      before stopping ticket renewer and/or removing
#			      the ticket. With secured FS relying on kerberos
#			      security, this can prevent from losing data 
#			      in case dirty pages flush are performed later 
#			      without any valid ticket for the user on the
#			      system.
#			      Note that this can cause performance degradation
#			      on the system and delay the termination of the 
#			      step.
#			      mode can be either no (default), yes, all.
#
# Users can alter the auks plugin behavior on command line using the
# parameter --auks=[yes|no|done] or the SLURM_SPANK_AUKS environment variable.
#
# When enabled, the Auks plugin put a copy of the user 's kerberos credential on
# the Auks server during submission (srun/sbatch/salloc) unless SLURM_SPANK_AUKS is
# set to "done". It then set SLURM_SPANK_AUKS to the "done" value. 
# Each slurmstepd get the  user's copy from the Auks server using its own credential 
# cache to prove its identity (aukspriv service can be used on each execution node to 
# ensure that a ticket is valid for that purpose). A command is launched to refresh the
# ticket in background during the jobstep execution.
#
# Note that one ticket is got per step on each execution node.
#
# When users use the --auks=done parameter, SLURM_SPANK_AUKS is set to "done" thus
# preventing the Auks plugin to put agin the credential on the auks server.
