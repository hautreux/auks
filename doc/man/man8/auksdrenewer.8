.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBauksdrenew\fR [\fI-h\fR] [\fI-dv\fR] [\fI-f auks.conf\fR] [\fI-l auks.log\fR]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
\fBauksdrenewer\fR is a privileged AUKS client running as a daemon which 
periodically tries to renew the remotely stored credentials.
.LP
A valid kerberos TGT corresponding to a user having the \fBadmin\fR role in the
\fBauksd\fR ACL rules must be reachable in the client environment.

.LP
Only one \fBauksdrenewer\fR should be active at a time. This daemon automatically
switch to the backup \fBauksd\fR daemon in case of problems with the first one.

\fBauksdrenewer\fR can be launched at startup using the eponymous service.
