auksd \- AUKS daemon serves add/get/remove/dump AUKS client requests

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBauksd\fR [\fI-h\fR] [\fI-dv\fR] [\fI-f auks.conf\fR]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
\fBAUKS\fR (\fBA\fRside \fBU\fRtility for \fBK\fRerberos \fBS\fRupport)
simplifies the use of a kerberized environment in batch system.
An AUKS daemon is a kind of kerberos TGT repository where users can store 
their credentials prior to launch batch jobs and administrators can get 
them to execute jobs with coresponding kerberos identity.
.LP
Only one TGT is stored by user. TGTs are stored by uid. As a result, 
credentials can only be stored for valid local users.
A valid local user is defined as a kerberos user whose principal can be 
translated to a valid local user on the system running the daemon.
When a user asks to add a credential, an already existing  one is only 
replaced if the proposed one is better in terms of durability.
.LP
Clients are authenticated using kerberos and authorized based on their 
principal name using rules defined in the \fIauks.acl\fR ACL file.
AUKS privileges are defined in this files by increasing capabilities 
as follows :
.TP
\fBunknown\fR
client authenticated using kerberos but not known to have any privilege
.TP
\fBguest\fR
client authorized to add kerberos credential on its own name
.TP
\fBuser\fR
client authorized to add/get/remove kerberos credentials that belong to him
.TP
\fBadmin\fR
client authorized to add/get/remove kerberos credentials in the name of any users.
client also authorized to dump all the available credentials.
.LP
The AUKS daemon doesn't manage credentials renewal. This is the purpose 
of the \fBauksdrenewer\fR which must be run by an \fBadmin\fR AUKS user.
.LP
The AUKS daemon is by default launched in background. Increasing verbosity 
on the command line can modify this behavior.
.LP
\fBauksd\fR can be launched at startup using the eponymous service.
